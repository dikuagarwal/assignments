    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.<br>\n",
    "Ans. A database is an organized collection of structured or unstructured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).<br>\n",
    "SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON. SQL databases are best suited for complex queries.<hr>"

    "The foreign key is a group of one or more columns in a database to uniquely identify another database record in some other table to maintain the referential integrity.
