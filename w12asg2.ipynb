    "Q1: Define overfitting and underfitting in machine learning. What are the consequences of each, and how\n",
    "can they be mitigated?<br>\n",
    "Ans. Overfitting and underfitting are common issues in machine learning that refer to the behavior of a model in relation to the training data and its generalization to new, unseen data. Overfitting model is highly accurate on the training data but performs poorly on new, unseen data. Overfitting can be seen as the model memorizing the training data rather than learning the underlying relationships. Consequences of overfitting include poor generalization, decreased performance on test data. Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the training data. It doesn't perform well on either the training data or new data because it fails to grasp the complexity of the problem. Underfitting can lead to suboptimal results and a lack of meaningful insights from the data.<br>\n",
    "For underfitting migration we Ensure that the model has access to relevant features that capture the complexity of the problem. Use more complex models that have the capacity to capture intricate relationships in the data.<br>\n",
    "For overfitting migration we split data into traing and validation dataset and use techniques likes cross validation to assess the model's performance on unseen data during training. Monitor the model's performance on a validation set during training and stop training when the performance starts to degrade.<hr>"

    "Q2: How can we reduce overfitting? Explain in brief.<br>\n",
    "Ans. To reduce overfitting we can use many techniques like:\n",
    "1. Regularization: Introduce regularization techniques like L1 or L2 regularization, which add penalty terms to the loss function, discouraging the model from assigning too much importance to any one feature or becoming too complex.\n",
    "2. Cross-Validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on different subsets of the training data. This helps to assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data.\n",
    "3. Early Stopping: Monitor the model's performance on a validation set during training and stop training when the performance on the validation set starts to degrade, preventing the model from overfitting to the training data.\n",
    "4. Feature Selection/Engineering: Focus on relevant features that provide meaningful information and remove irrelevant or redundant features that could lead to overfitting.\n",
    "5. Ensemble Methods: Combine predictions from multiple models (ensemble) to reduce the impact of individual model biases and improve overall generalization.\n",

    "Ans. Underfitting occurs when a machine learning model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns present in the data. It results in poor performance on both the training data and new, unseen data, because the model fails to grasp the complexity of the problem. Here are some scenarios where underfitting can occur in machine learning:\n",

    "Q4: Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning. What is the relationship between bias and\n",
    "variance, and how do they affect model performance?<br>\n",
    "Ans. The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that illustrates the relationship between two sources of error that affect a model's performance: bias and variance. Achieving a good tradeoff between bias and variance is crucial for building generalised model. The bias-variance tradeoff demonstrates the inverse relationship between bias and variance. As you reduce bias, variance tends to increase, and vice versa. when you make the model more complex (reducing bias), it can fit the training data better, but it's more likely to overfit (increase variance). Models with high bias and low variance might be lead underfitting and model with low bias and high variance perform well on training dataset but it can lead overfitting issue. Ideally, we want to strike a balance between bias and variance. This results in a model that generalizes well to new data.<hr>"

    "Ans. Bias and variance are two important concepts in machine learning that describe the sources of errors a model can encounter. They are related to a model's ability to generalize well to new, unseen data.<br>\n",
    "High bias indicates that the model is overly simplistic and unable to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Examples of high bias models include linear regression applied to non-linear relationships or a decision tree with very shallow depth on a complex dataset.<br>\n",
    "High variance indicates that the model is overly complex and has learned to fit the noise in the training data rather than the underlying patterns. High-variance models perform well on the training data but poorly on new data, as they fail to generalize beyond the training data. Examples of high variance models include very deep decision trees that can fit noise, or complex ensemble methods like Random Forests with numerous highly tuned trees.<br>\n",
    "igh bias models are too simple and don't capture underlying patterns, leading to poor performance on both training and new data. High variance models are too complex, capturing noise and leading to overfitting and poor performance on new data. The goal is to strike a balance between bias and variance to achieve a model that generalizes well to new, unseen data. This balance can often be achieved through techniques like regularization, cross-validation, and model selection based on the complexity of the problem and the available data.<hr>"

    "Ans. Regularization is a set of techniques used in machine learning to prevent overfitting. Regularization techniques work by adding penalties or constraints to the model's optimization process, guiding it towards simpler, less overfitting-prone solutions. The choice of regularization technique and its hyperparameters depends on the specific problem, the type of model being used, and the characteristics of the data.<hr>"
