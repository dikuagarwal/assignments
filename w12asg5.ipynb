    "Q1. What is data encoding? How is it useful in data science?<br>\n",
    "Ans. Data encoding is process of converting categorical feature to a numerical feature so that it can be used for analysis, modeling, and machine learning tasks. In data science, data encoding is crucial because many algorithms and models require numeric input. <hr>"

    "Q2. What is nominal encoding? Provide an example of how you would use it in a real-world scenario.<br>\n",
    "Ans. Nominal encoding, also known as categorical encoding, is a technique used to convert categorical variables with nominal or unordered categories into a numerical format that can be used for analysis and modeling. One of the most common methods of nominal encoding is \"One-Hot Encoding.\"<hr>"

    "Q3. In what situations is nominal encoding preferred over one-hot encoding? Provide a practical example.<br>\n",
    "Ans. the choice between nominal encoding and one-hot encoding depends on your specific goals, the nature of the categorical variable, and the characteristics of your dataset.When dealing with categorical variables with a high number of categories (high cardinality), one-hot encoding can lead to a significant increase in the number of features, which might cause issues with computational efficiency and model complexity. Nominal encoding reduces the dimensionality of the data and can be a more memory-efficient choice in such cases. f you have limited data and too many categories, nominal encoding might be a better choice, as it doesn't create separate features for each category.<hr>"

    "Ans. In this case i will prefare one-hot encoding techniques because no of unique categories is less. One-Hot Encoding preserves the original categorical information while representing it numerically. Each unique value gets its own binary column, making it easy for machine learning algorithms to work with.<hr>"
