    "Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.<br>\n",
    "Ans. Abstraction is the process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world. Abstraction is used to describe things in simple terms. It's used to create a boundary between the application and the client programs. Making coffee with a coffee machine is a good example of  a real world abstraction. "

    "Q2. Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.<br>\n",
    "Ans. The most significant difference between the two is that data abstraction is a method which helps to hide the unwanted data from the user, while data encapsulation is a method which helps to hide data using a single entity. Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details of a system from the user, and only the functional details will be available to the user end. On the other hand, Encapsulation is a method of wrapping up the data and code acting on the data into a single unit."

    "Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?<br>\n",
    "Ans. The 'abc' module in Python library provides the infrastructure for defining custom abstract base classes.'abc' works by marking methods of the base class as abstract. This is done by @absttractmethod decorator. "

    "Ans. Data Abstraction in Python can be achieved through creating abstract classes and inheriting them later. "

    "Q5. Can we create an instance of an abstract class? Explain your answer.<br>\n",
    "Ans. Abstract classes are not complete, as they may have some methods that are not defined. So we cannot create an instance or object of an abstract class in Python."
