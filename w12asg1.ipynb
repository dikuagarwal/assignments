    "Q1. A). AI: Artifical inteligance or AI is a basically smart application that can perform it's own task withot human interaction. It's envolves tech like ML, DL, NLP etcc. example of AI is google assistanet, smart automatic car etc. AI is the field of computer science focused on creating machines and software that can simulate human-like intelligence and decision-making.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "B). ML:  ML is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance on specific tasks over time. It's proviees statstool to analyze, visualize and developing models and performing forcasting. Ex: Amazon and netflix recommadation system.<br>\n",

    "Q2- What is supervised learning? List some examples of supervised learning.<br>\n",
    "Ans. Supervised learning is one type of ML where the algorithm learns from a labeled dataset. In supervised learning, the training data includes input features (also called attributes or variables) along with their corresponding output labels or target values. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping from input features to output labels so that the algorithm can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. Student pass fail prediction based on their study hours, flat price prediction based on no of rooms and size of flat.<hr>"

    "Ans. this is also one type of ML where the algorithm learns from an unlabeled dataset. In unsupervised learning, the training data consists only of input features, and there are no corresponding output labels or target values. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find patterns, structures, or relationships within the data without having predefined categories or labels. example of unsupevised ML is making cluster or group of similar type of data like Identifying groups of customers with similar behaviors for targeted marketing.<hr>"

    "Q7- How can unsupervised learning be used in anomaly detection?<br>\n",
    "Ans. Anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is a process of identifying data points or instances that significantly deviate from the expected or normal behavior within a dataset. Anomaly detection is a crucial task in various fields, as it helps identify unusual or unexpected events that might indicate errors, fraud, faults, or novel behaviors.<br>\n",
    "Unsupervised learning can be highly effective in anomaly detection tasks due to its ability to uncover patterns and anomalies in data without relying on labeled examples. Clustering algorithms group similar data points together. Anomalies, being dissimilar from the majority, might not fit well into any cluster. Therefore, data points that don't belong to any cluster or are in sparsely populated clusters can be considered anomalies.<hr>"
